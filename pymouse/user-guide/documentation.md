PyMouse is a bot developed in [<mark style="color:yellow;">**Python**</mark>](https://www.python.org/) by BubbalooTeam, with the collaboration of the [<mark style="color:purple;">**Hydrogram**</mark>](https://hydrogram.org) and [<mark style="color:orange;">**HydroKeyboard**</mark>](https://github.com/DaviisDev/HydroKeyboard/blob/master/README.md#hydrokeyboard) libraries.

2. **Ease of Use:** _We have simplified the features so that anyone can enjoy them._
3. **Fun:** _In addition to being useful, PyMouse also brings a smile to users' faces. 🎉_

## Functionalities&#x20;

PyMouse can:

* **Day-to-day assistance:** _Weather forecast, jokes, among others._
